# Colab-Notebooks
A collection of Google Colab notebooks with Python, dark matter, and data visualization tutorials and exercises. 

The notebooks labeled "Week 1" through "Week 7" were originally used as interactive components of the *Dark Matter & Data Visualization* course at [USC Hybrid High School](https://www.ednovate.org/hybrid) in Spring 2022, supported by a [Carnegie Observatories](https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/) DEI grant and [Create Now](https://createnow.org/); see the full course syllabus [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f9bxYBslAa2ewfoNRDVXP7rPLzTOJFpWmnJYcIwo1MU/edit?usp=sharing).

The notebooks labeled "stream_viz" were used as activities for [USC Hybrid High School](https://www.ednovate.org/hybrid) and [John Muir High School](https://www.pusd.us/muir) visits to Carnegie Observatories, from 2022-2024, and co-authored with [Ana Bonaca](https://obs.carnegiescience.edu/dr-ana-bonaca-0) and [Chris Couto](https://directory.caltech.edu/personnel/ccouto).
